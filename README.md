## üåà HSV? In my CSS?! üåà

Yes, this is real HSV.

```scss
.hsv-based {
    --hsv-value: hsl(40 90 20); /* no-sense, it's hsv */

    // for string interpolation
    $L: calc((l / 100) * (1 - (s / 100) * 0.5));
    $S: calc(((l / 100) - #{$L}) / min(#{$L}, 1 - #{$L}));

    // use string interpolated $S and $L calc math
    background-color: hsl(from var(--hsv-value) h calc(#{$S} * 100) calc(#{$L} * 100));
}
```

## üî∞ Less for your hopes, my small troll... üî∞

> Code to block some actions of naive users...

Ideal scenario for protect from ban avoid...
Why? Because after clear cache, memory process still remain
You can pass ban-system only if you block such events, or if you clear store in out of process

```js
//some process or memory still remains even after clearing storage...
addEventListener("beforeunload", saveToStorage);
addEventListener("pagehide", saveToStorage);

//
document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", (ev)=>{
    if (document.visibilityState === "hidden") {
        saveToStorage(ev);
    }
});

// but using such events may broke mechanism...
addEventListener("storage", (ev)=>{
    if (ev.storageArea == localStorage) {

    }
});
```
