## ⚠️ Cautions

**My profile/account under risks to be got flagged!**

There are indications of [BPD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder), [CPTSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_post-traumatic_stress_disorder)... Also has an official diagnosis of [Asperger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome)'s. There are also isolated signs of [ADHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder) and [OCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive–compulsive_disorder). Like autistic people, I can have [Meltdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autistic_meltdown) and Shutdown. ❌

Also de jure, de facto, the fact of [**emotional dysregulation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_dysregulation) has already been proven (despite the lack of direct indication in the diagnosis). Consider that emotional dysregulation is simply already proven to be 100% just by inference.

## 🗿 My true tenets 🗿

- I don't self-medicate - I do everything I can to somehow stand on my feet, until the first free time...
- I know I'm doing things that are not directly related to my life - however, I'm stuffing (myself) with the yet another (possibly important) trump/proof/win cards and arguments...
- I'd like to get a job, but I don't want to be enslaved forever by location, low pay, chronic illness, etc...
- I'm in the process of laying out all the forces on my map so that I have somewhere to approach employers from, with a lot of security.
- I don't want to show up anywhere with nothing on my hands, not even my own or important tools.
- I want to do everything I can to make my entire future path to action easier, and have roadmaps for everything.
- I don't want to be extremely dependent on third party vendors and developers who can cut my ends off (don't vendor.lock).
- I know I risk not being able to do anything, but I'm doing my best not to get desperate and panic, and most importantly not to go crazy.
- I don't walk away or avoid problems or responsibilities altogether, however I may leave or put off what is not a proper priority and only tackle the important when fully prepared.
- And yet, I'm still not immune to anything, not at all...
- I don't want a wife - I want a partner...
- I don't look for ways that are too easy or cheap, but I do prefer guaranteed or benefitable/profitable/favourable ways...
- Persuasion and evidence are more important than honesty and being right...
- To me, faith in God means trusting in the unknown, uncertainty, unpredictability... and god doesn't like control, speculation, guesswork, assumptions, or inference... There is no room for ego or mindness here.
- **And in general, the best way to ruin your own life is to ruin the lives of others!**

**And, I know it about myself...**

> "In your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood..." i.e., you have only lost property and glory, suffered exile, but have not shed blood as Christ shed His blood for you.

*Hebrews 12:4*
